A suite of sprite-based tools for [S&box](https://sbox.game/) inspired by [GameMaker](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm).

# Usage

***Please only download the library directly through s&box to ensure you're downloading the most stable version of the library.***

This repo can be cloned as a game project with the library pre-installed and will eventually serve as an example project.
